# The Zigvy Times

## Description

  This is a **Small Project Test** for online interview at Zigvy Corp. The requirement is to create a blog website. But I used the React Native framework to write a mobile application in a completely different way and a different UI.

**Technical**

  - React Native
  - Firebase
  
## Important note

My advice is that you should only run on iPhone 11(Simulator).
